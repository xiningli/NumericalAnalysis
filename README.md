# NumericalAnalysis Kit

This is a open source free software. Most of them are based on the course Numerical Analysis

taught by Professor Mohammad Riazi of Fort Hays State University. I collected the notes and

wrote most of algorithms. Some of them are collected from other scholars on the Internet.

This software can be revised, spread, and sold. Integration: Trapezoid Rule, Simpsonâ€™s Rule,

Newton-Cotes Open Formulas, Romberg Integration (Richardson Extrapolation applied on the

Trapezoid Rule or other integration methods), Gaussian Quadrature, and Riemann Sum.

Differential Equations: Adam-Bashford, Runge-Kutta, Euler, Boundary Value Solver.
